The dino coloring problem: like regular graph coloring but for pictures of dinosaurs. The goal is to find not just any 4-coloring, but the fastest one that can be input through Color a Dinosaur's awkward controls and slow flood fills.

Basically, each color and each node has a weight. The value of each vertex is equal to the vertex weight times the color weight, and we want to minimize the sum over all vertices. For much, much more detail on the processes and motivations, see https://tasvideos.org/Forum/Topics/25305.

## Input Format

I'm workin' on it!! For now, just try to figure it out from the .in files.
